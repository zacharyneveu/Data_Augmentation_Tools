# About
This repo is a place where I plan to play around with data augmentation using style transfer networks such as CycleGAN.  

# Ideas
+ Measure improved performance with more sophisticated augmentation
+ Build simple tool to label a dataset quickly by starting with a few images, and using heavy augmentation to find similar images, allowing the user to quickly label initial data, and assist neural net in classifying remaining data.
